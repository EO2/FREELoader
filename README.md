Download a file from several mirrors at once.

Splits the download into byte ranges and download them into part files.
Later,  when all parts have been downloaded, the files are joined together.

Usage:

FREELoader url [url ...]



Add as many urls as bash arguments support (how many?)
Makes little sense to run with only one url, but still possible.
